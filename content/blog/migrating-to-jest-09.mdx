#### Stats

So the stuff people always want to know is: "Is it really faster?" Well...
Here's some clipped output from running the test commands with `time` before and
after (note that the before tests are from over a month ago so there are a few
more tests in the after numbers):

_If you're unfamiliar with the time command see
[this](https://linux.die.net/man/1/time). "real" is the thing we're focusing on
here._

_Note: This is with the cache in all cases. I ran the tests several times in a
row with my machine otherwise idle to get the best numbers I could for all
tests. I also ran these with code coverage because that's what our git hook
runs. Also, you'll notice there are more total tests to run in the "after" case
because "before" is one month ago._

So here are some important stats based on my runs:

**UI Before**: 144ms per test

**UI After:** 28ms per test

**Server Before:** 111ms per test

**Server After:** 116ms per test

One thing that I found with Jest is that the ms/test stat decreases as you add
tests. Turns out it's really good at running tests in parallel. So I expect we'd
see a wider gap with more tests.
