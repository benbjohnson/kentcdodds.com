But a few weeks later I gave it a go:

I was impressed at how fast it was and even more how easy it was to set up.
Especially since I'd tried Jest before and it was soooo slow. And I was really
encouraged by this tweet from [Mike Nikles](https://twitter.com/mikenikles):

I was slowly discovering the truth of this statement:

So I eventually
[swapped AVA for Jest](https://github.com/kentcdodds/generator-kcd-oss/commit/23f8875358db204d16e040a14ee44aaa79681691)
for my open source module generator and now all my open source stuff is Jest and
I love it ðŸ’š .

As is the case for me, when I get excited about new tech, I really like to
share! So I created [a bunch of videos](http://kcd.im/egghead-jest) for
egghead.io about it, had a
[tech chat](https://github.com/kentcdodds/ama/issues/125) with
[Christoph Pojer](https://twitter.com/cpojer)
[on YouTube](https://youtu.be/i31VtyJSM-I?list=PLV5CVI1eNcJi8sor_aQ2AzOeQ3On3suOr&index=20)
about Jest, and rewrote my React Testing Workshop **again** in
[Jest](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-jest-workshop).
