So,
[I convinced my team at PayPal](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/720359271469162496)
and we started using AVA for all our new React tests. I was getting ready to
start migrating our existing UI tests and our server tests when I started to
notice something about AVA that really put a wrench in the whole thing.

It turns out that AVA was created to be fast for lots of async tests. Not for
large test suites of async and sync tests. So for the use cases in my
application, I found this to be true:
