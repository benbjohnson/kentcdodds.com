### Why migrate to Jest instead of Mocha?

So, at this point, we had all our React tests with AVA, previous UI tests
(mostly backbone) with Mocha, and server tests with Mocha. The natural choice
was to move all our stuff to Mocha. But then I got involved in this thread:

Which led to
[this comment](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/250#issuecomment-236980910)
from [Trevor D. Miller](https://twitter.com/trevordmiller) which I
[responded to](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/250#issuecomment-236985503)
(in which I mention that I'd write this very blog post about me migrating from
AVA to Mocha... I'd already started migrating my React Testing workshop to Mocha
[here](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-mocha-workshop). Hah). Then
[Christoph Pojer](https://twitter.com/cpojer) responded with
[this great comment](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/250#issuecomment-237098619).
That pretty much won my curiosity back and I decided to give it another go on a
project.

Unfortunately, I didn't have time to look into it right away, even though I
wanted to:
