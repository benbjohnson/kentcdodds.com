### Was it worth it?

For the client-side stuff, I can say for sure absolutely positively YES:

As for the server side. Well, my PR for the server changes was just merged
yesterday, so I can only say I _think_ that it was worth it. Jest provides a ton
of great features, not the least of which is amazing performance as the number
of tests grow. It's exposes a surprisingly powerful API with great and
reasonable defaults. Jest ships with
[easy code coverage instrumentation and reporting](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-track-project-code-coverage-with-jest?pl=testing-javascript-with-jest-a36c4074)
right out of the box. It has
[an interactive watch mode](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-use-jest-s-interactive-watch-mode?pl=testing-javascript-with-jest-a36c4074)
that I love. It has the best mocking story of anything I've ever seen. It has
[snapshot assertsions](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-use-jest-s-snapshot-testing-feature?pl=testing-javascript-with-jest-a36c4074)
which work really well for React components, server responses, and redux state.
And most importantly, I think my co-workers and I will _stop_ running
`git push --no-verify` like we were before which will help our productivity, so
I think that it's definitely worth the migration!
