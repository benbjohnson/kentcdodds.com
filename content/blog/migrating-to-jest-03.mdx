It was just too much. As much as I loved all the other amazing and awesome
features the AVA team had worked on (and there are many), performance was so
poor I couldn't enjoy them as much. As the testbase grew to hundreds of tests,
my MacBook Pro was brought to its knees. My fans would spin up like an airplane
ready to take flight ðŸ›© and it wouldn't respond to me reliably until the tests
were done.

[These performance issues](https://github.com/avajs/ava/labels/performance) led
to my team (myself included) skipping the githooks with `--no-verify` so we
wouldn't have to wait to push our code changes. This led to the build breaking
for really simple things (like linting errors and broken tests) which slowed our
team down a lot.

Another major issue we found was with AVA's testing assertions. They use
[power-assert](http://npm.im/power-assert) which is an amazingly helpful
utility, but would sometimes lead to reeeeally weird things happening (like
[this](https://github.com/avajs/ava/issues/616)). I realize that these are
things that can be fixed, but as AVA is a community project built in the spare
time of contributors (thank [you](https://github.com/avajs) and
[you](https://github.com/power-assert-js) so much!), those things getting fixed
often took time. Along with that, engineers on my team sunk hours upon hours of
work trying to figure out where these issues were and working around them. We
don't have that kind of time.
